# Suicide-Rate-Analytics
Personal Project

I performed an analytics about suicide rates as my personal project for learning in my free time. I performed descriptive, diagnostic and predcitve analytics using multiple libraries such as summarytools(), ggplot2, psych to perform them. I generated plots using ggplot to show relations of variables, and also used linear regression, ANCOVA, ANOVA, levene test, etc to generate and test the models.
